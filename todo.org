* core
** DONE CCL support
   Gonna need to write my own queue (probably based on chanl)
** DONE Selective receive
** DONE Nice messages for exits and downs
   The concept of exits, errors, and link/monitor signals needs a facelift. It's a bit all over the
   place right now. Rethink the API and export all the appropriate things to make the whole API
   useful.
** DONE Links
   Need to kill or message processes, as appropriate, based on the actor-stop type.
** DONE Monitors
   Need to message monitor processes with the proper message.
** DONE exits
   Exiting/killing from within the current actor should unconditionally signal a stop. It should
   also not do an interrupt.
** DONE Living with interrupts
   Basically, SBCL doesn't wrap its cleanup-forms in without-interrupts, so unwind-protect isn't
   fully 'safe' in SBCL. So, if you want safe unwind-protect, nag SBCL hackers about it. CCL does
   The Right Thing, though. :) In the meantime, signal-exit has been made a little safer by
   preventing interruption of the interrupt itself.
** DONE actor-shutdown
   Add another actor-stop type to signify when a clean shutdown request has
   been sent to an actor.
** DONE Don't clobber name registration
   Throw an error or something if a name already exists, instead of just
   overwriting the current name setting. Alternately, warn when a name is
   clobbered like that.
   Of course, if the name already exists, we may not want to start the
   actor at all, lest we're left with an anonymous actor somewhere out
   there.
** DONE Actor designators
   Since we have a registration system, actor-related functions should
   accept either symbols or actual actor objects.
** DONE i/o
   Might be nice to have all actor-based I/O go through a single, locked stream that makes sure all
   i/o units are ordered properly.
   It may be Good Enough to just write a quick gray-streams stream wrapper that will grab a lock
   when trying to write-sequence/write-string. See how it goes.
   Update: Wtf? Was I imagining things? Output seems to be perfectly
   ordered now. FML.
   Update: Not my problem. If anyone wants ordered output, they can write
   their own server(s) to arrange for output delivery however they need.
** DONE SBCL
   Get this shit working with sbcl. I seem to be messing up the interrupts logic.
** DONE Error on bad links/monitors
   If you try to link to or monitor a dead actor, there should be an error.
** DONE Erlang-style exits
   Just give up on it for now -- have a single exit condition, and do
   different things depending on the reason attached to it.
** DONE Signal handling
   It should *not be possible* to handle remote signals with a
   handler-case. Remote signals must be handled with trap-exits, or be
   allowed to kill the process.
** DONE Remote exit signals
   Right now, when we (exit 'foo some-actor), that actor receives a
   link-exit, even though it's not really a link exit.
   This should be resolved either by adding an exit-signal or remote-exit
   type that will be sent as the message when regular remote exits happen,
   or the exit-signal/remote-exit type should replace link-exit.
** TODO Export with/without-interrupts API
   A cleaned-up with/without-interrupts API should be made available to
   users so they can protect important forms from mori's signaling
   mechanisms.
** TODO Dynamic vars
   There's still a good number of dynamic vars that are really just
   global. Hide these and the associated locks behind closures.
** TODO Recursive locks?
   I sort of defensively spammed with-recursive-lock-held, but this may be
   detrimental to performance (and give the wrong impression
   sometimes?). Is it really necessary to use this in all cases? Is using
   it actually hiding real bugs?
** TODO Race conditions?
   Crawl through actor.lisp looking for potential race conditions. Wrap the
   appropriate places with the appropriate locks.
** TODO Pid system
   Explore this idea. What's special about pids compared to the current
   actor implementation? What's good? It seems useful for debugging
   purposes, and might be pretty easy to add once mori has a global actor
   list.
** TODO Debugging
   Really sucks. Either we get silent failures, or we get slammed with
   sldb.
*** DONE One sldb at a time for actors
    Be kind. Put a lock around the invoke-debugger in actors.
    NOTE: Keep an eye on this. It may cause problems to serialize debugging.
*** DONE Logger actor
    It would be quite nice to have a logger actor that gets started right
    away that reports process crashes in an orderly manner. This will then
    also be useful for regular, orderly logging in a concurrent world.
**** DONE Basic logger
**** DONE Report unhandled crashes
*** TODO Enough is enough
    When you have 100 actors crashing with the same error and all of them
    have debug enabled, you're just gonna get the same error again. Add a
    restart that lets you ignore (or pick a certain restart) for all errors
    for the next N seconds or so.
    NOTE - this is going to involve having a single, global debug-enabled
    setting, instead of a dynamic variable. Not sure if this is the way to
    go. Just leave it as it is for now.
*** TODO Stop the world
    Would be nice if you could stop all threads from the repl :\
** TODO Actor-only calls
   Some calls/call options can only be accessed when (current-actor) is bound to a valid
   actor. Complain loudly and early when attempts are made to access these outside the scope of a
   spawned actor.
   This is getting pretty annoying, specially when using hip-srv:call
   inadvertedly.
** TODO gproc
   gproc looks like regular Erlang process registration on steroids. Maybe it's worth using that as
   a model for hip's actor registration system (mixed with CL's concept of designators).
** TODO Document API
** TODO Actorize
   Is it possible to, at least partially, convert the current thread into an actor? Can it be done
   automagically?
** TODO stack sizes
   Make stack sizes controllable? Maybe make the default stack size smaller
   than usual?
* logger
** DONE Optional loading
   Using the logger should be optional, although easy to do.
** TODO trivial-backtrace
   Looks like this could give some useful information to print out.
** TODO supervision
   The logger really should be supervised properly.
** TODO timestamps
   Slap a timestamp in there to make things easier to track.
** TODO More
   Erlang has its own fancy error logger, which uses gen_event:
   http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/error_logger.html
* timer
** DONE Implement the functions in timer.lisp
** DONE SBCL
   Get this shit working with sbcl
** TODO Figure out what to do about CCL
   It looks like trivial-timer's implementation of timers is putting way
   too much load on CCL, which is noticeable when the timeouts are
   relatively small. Is there a way to improve it so it's not so bad?
** TODO Document API
** TODO Merge *-after/*-interval to be able to do both
   Maybe. Think about it.
* server
** DONE start
** DONE enter-loop
** DONE cast
** DONE info
** DONE react to callback results
   erlang gen_server callbacks let you do things like {stop, Reason}, {noreply, State}, etc. Perhaps
   the lisp equivalent of this would be special functions that, when called in their scope, alter
   the standard return behavior by throwing something.
   UPDATE - instead of basing things on the return values, all callbacks have exit-server-loop
   available to immediately break from the server loop. Additionally, on-call can defer replying to
   its caller by calling (defer-call-reply).
** DONE call
   This includes implementing REPLY. Throw in a macro to make it simpler, too.
*** DONE reply
*** DONE Multiple values
    hipocrite.mailbox::do-selective-receive is messing with the multiple
    value returns. :(
** TODO defcall/defcast
*** DONE implicit server
    Sometimes, we want the actor the call/cast is being sent to to be implicit in the API function.
*** TODO lambda lists
    Use the provided lambda-list to construct the API function lambda-list.
*** TODO declarations
    Accept declarations (for the API call only?)
** TODO Document API
* event
** TODO Implement a gen_event clone
   This'll probably also be useful for the logger, so it's definitely a nice-to-have.
* supervisor
** TODO Orderly shutdown
   On receiving a shutdown signal, the supervisor should send a shutdown to
   all its children, and wait for a certain amount of time to make sure
   they've all shut down, before shutting itself down. If the children take
   too long to shut down, they should be brutally killed.
** TODO one-for-one supervisor
   One shutdown = one restart
** TODO one-for-all supervisor
   One shutdown = all children are restarted
** TODO simple-one-for-one sup
   Simpler API for managing many children that share most of a child spec.
** TODO Sexy, lispy API
* application
** TODO Research about what application provides.
