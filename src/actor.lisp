If the test form is the symbol `after`, the second element must evaluate to
a number to be used as `receive-cond`'s timeout, and the rest of the forms
will be executed as an implicit `progn` to yield `receive-cond`'s return
value(s).

`receive-cond` is different from doing `(let ((val (receive))) (cond ...))`
in that it is able to 'pick' messages out of anywhere in the actor's
message queue, while still leaving all other messages in-place, in the
order they arrived.

Example:

```lisp
 (receive-cond (msg)
  ((eq msg 'hello-world)
   (print \"Oh, hello!\"))
  (after 10
   (print \"I'm not interested in waiting this long!\")))

(defun selective-receive (test &key timeout on-timeout)
"This function can be used to implement custom selective receive
operators similar to `receive-cond`. For example, it can be used to
implement a macro that picks a message from the mailbox using a given
pattern-matching library.

`test` must be a function that accepts a message as its only argument. If
it returns `nil`, the message will be skipped and `test` will be called on
the next message, until a matching message is found (or `selective-receive`
will block until a matching message is received). If the message is
accepted, `test` must return a one-argument function that will then be
called on the chosen message and whose values will be returned from
`selective-receive`.

`timeout` and `on-timeout` work as described in `receive`.

For example, on could write a `receive-match` macro that uses the `optima`
pattern-matching library:

```lisp
 (defmacro receive-match (&body clauses &aux timeout on-timeout)
  (alexandria:with-unique-names (obj)
    `(mori:selective-receive
      (lambda (,obj)
        (optima:match ,obj

               if (and (symbolp pattern)
                       (string-equal 'after pattern))
               do (when on-timeout
                    (warn \"Multiple AFTER clauses in RECEIVE-MATCH\"))
                 (setf timeout (car body)
                       on-timeout `(lambda () ,@(cdr body)))
               else
               collect `(,pattern (lambda (,obj)
                                    (declare (ignore ,obj))
                                    ;; Doing it this way allows
                                    ;; declarations related to the
                                    ;; THEN-form.

      :timeout ,timeout
      :on-timeout ,on-timeout)))
```

Which can then be used like:

```lisp
 (receive-match
  (1 (print \"Got a 1\"))
  ((list x y z) (values x y z))
  (after 5 (print \"Whatever\")))
